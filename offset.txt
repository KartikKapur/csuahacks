l SOLUTIONS TO PRACTICE PROBLEMS

1. Take arbitrary vectors u = (u1,.. . , Lin) and v 2 (v1, . . . , U”) in R”, and compute
u + V 2 (ul + 121, . . . , un + 1)”) Deﬁnition of vector addition
2 (v1 + u1, . . . , 1),, + un) Commutativity of addition in R
= V + u Deﬁnition of vector addition

2. The vector y belongs to Span {V1, V2, V3} if and only if there exist scalars x1, x2, x3

such that
l 5 —3 —4
X1 —1 + x2 —4 -I- X3 1 = 3
—2 —7 0 h

This vector equation is equivalent to a system of three linear equations in three
unknowns. If you row reduce the augmented matrix for this system, you ﬁnd that

l 5 —3 —4 l 5 —3 —4 l 5 —3 —4
—l —4 l 3 ~ 0 l —2 —1 ~ 0 l —2 —l
—2 —7 0 h 0 3 —6 h — 8 0 0 0 h — 5

The system is consistent if and only if there is no pivot in the fourth column. That
is, h — 5 must be 0. So y is in Span {V1, V2, V3} if and only if h = 5.

Remember: The presence of a free variable in a system does not guarantee that the
system is consistent.

1.4 THE MATRIX EQUATION Ax = b

A fundamental idea in linear algebra is to view a linear combination of vectors as the
product of a matrix and a vector. The following deﬁnition permits us to rephrase some
of the concepts of Section 1.3 in new ways.
